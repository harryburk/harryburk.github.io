		<div id="gsContent1">
			<p>Getting started with fish-keeping for the first time may seem hard, there's lots of equipment required and many different brands and styles. With this breakdown we'll make it easy.</p>
			<h5>What You Need</h5>
			<p>First, you'll obviously need an aquarium. For a beginner, you want probably want something between 21 and 40 litres. Keep in mind though that 21 really is the minimum here, especially for tropical fish. While less may be alright for one or two goldfish, you'll need more for a tropical tank. Also, while 40 litres is a good size beginner tank, you'll probably still need to upgrade in the future, so if you're certain of you're hobby - and have the money for it - a bigger tank is always better, and saves the hassle of migrating to a new tank later.</p>
			<p><b>Other things you'll need include:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>A Filter - Many beginner aquariums come with one already</li>
				<li>Lighting - Most brand-name aquariums will have this installed in the roof already</li>
				<li>Substrate (Gravel or sand, although gravel is <i>considerably</i> easier to maintain)</li>
				<li>Hiding Spots - A few plants as the bare minimum, all fish need somewhere to hide otherwise they get stressed</li>
				<li>Heater - Depending on where you live</li>
				<li>Fish flakes/pellets</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="gsContent2">
			<h5>What You Might Want</h5>
			<p>Some other things that aren't completely necessary, but may make managing you're aquarium a ot easier, or a lot more fun:
			<ul>
				<li>Thermostat</li>
				<li>Net</li>
				<li>Decoration - Adding to the hiding spots, spruce it up with some themed decor</li>
				<li>Beginning chemicals - There are several chemical bacteria's you can buy that makes setting up the aquarium environment a lot quicker, such as water agers, tropical (good) bacterias, and anti-disease drops</li>
				<li>A secondary food source - flakes everyday could get boring, get some pellets, or even better, some brine worms or dried shrimp to give your fish a varied diet</li>
				<li>Water quality/pH test kit</li>
			</ul>
